SMART TOKEN BOOTH

Smart Token Booth system is a system to remove the queue from the places
where users need to stand in a line for any service.

The full solution needs a computer to act as server and each service 
booth needs a small device to communicate with the server. Token counter
will also need to have a small device.

The most interesting and important feature is the whole system does not
need any wiring. All communications with server is done via radio
transmission. And it's easy to configure :-).

This is the server part (which resides on a pc). It is build with Qt
framework and works on Linux, Window and Mac (tested on Ubuntu 11.04,
Windows 7). It needs the QSerialDevice which can be found here -
https://gitorious.org/qserialdevice . It is under GPL license.
